# NLP Tasks Portfolio

This repository contains **6 end-to-end Natural Language Processing (NLP) projects** completed as part of my internship. Each project demonstrates practical applications of NLP techniques using Python, machine learning, and transformer models.  

All notebooks are also available on my **[Kaggle profile](https://www.kaggle.com/shahzaib2222)**.  

All **video demos for these 6 tasks** are compiled in a **single LinkedIn post**: [LinkedIn Post/Video Link]()
